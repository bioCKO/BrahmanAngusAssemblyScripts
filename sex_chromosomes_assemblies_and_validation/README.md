# Sex chromosomes assemblies and validation
---

Some custom scripts to analyse and validate cattle sex chromosome assembly

## Table of contents
* Chromosome validation
* PAR comparison
* Plots

### Chromosome validation

This folder contains scripts for chromosome validation including
identification of sex chromosome contigs from contig level
assembly, Hi-C and optical map scaffolding comparison and checking
potential missing X chromosome contigs.

The resources we used for contig identification are X chromosome RH
map markes from BovGen RH map,SUNbRH7000-rad map, USDA-MARC Bovine
linkage map and Y chromosome RH markers from Liu <em>et al</em> 2002.

### PAR comparison

This folder contains scripts for PAR gene comparisons in mammals. PAR
genes are downloaded from representive reference genome and have been
formated to gff for PAR gene plots. 

### Plots

This folder contains scripts for cattle XY chromosome vs XY chromosome
from other mammals using lastz and PAR gene track plots using gviz R package.
