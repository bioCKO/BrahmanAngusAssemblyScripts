# Comparison of gaps
The recent water buffalo genome assembly (UOA_WB_1) with contig N50 of 18.8 Mb and only 383 gaps has surpassed the human genome (GRCh38.p12) with respect to sequence contiguity. However, it should be noted that the human genome has more metacentric chromosomes and it has more extensive work done to improve centromeric and telomeric sequences. The recent Hereford cattle (ARS-UCD1.2) assembly is another highly contiguous mammalian genome. Therefore, sequence gaps in these selected mammalian genomes with high quality assemblies were compared to our Angus and Brahman assemblies. The methodology is similar to [Low et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08260-0). The following scripts are relevant to this analysis.
