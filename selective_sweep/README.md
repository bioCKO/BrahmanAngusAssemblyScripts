# selective sweep
To facilitate better processing of SNPs and the count of alternate alleles, the annotated VCF files were first separated into individual chromosome files. Then an Rscript was ran to loop through each chromosomes and below are the relevant scripts for this selective sweep analysis in which Brahman was used as the reference genome.
