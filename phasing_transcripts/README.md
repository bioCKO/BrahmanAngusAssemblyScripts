# Phasing transcripts
The description on how to obtain high-quality (HQ) transcripts using [isoseq3](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda), [Cupcake](https://github.com/Magdoll/cDNA_Cupcake) and [SQANTI2](https://github.com/Magdoll/SQANTI2) was described comprehensively in the main manuscript. The phasing part is documented in [IsoPhase](https://github.com/Magdoll/cDNA_Cupcake/wiki/IsoPhase:-Haplotyping-using-Iso-Seq-data).

The following script was used to find overlap between SNPs called between Iso-Seq, RNA-Seq and WGS genomic DNA: brahman_angus_IsoPhase_rerunningLiz_vcf.R
